**VCV Rack 2**

Notes:
1) use Trowasoft cvOSCcv module (NOTE if on Rack2 then try this release https://github.com/j4s0n-c/trowaSoft-VCV/releases)
2) configure to use serial2OSC in individual mode.
3) you can scale in cvOSCvc but not invert do that in serial2OSC
4) the trigger out on cvOSCcv is no use as serial2OSC sends data constantly and not on change
